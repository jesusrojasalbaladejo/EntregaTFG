5.          TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n\
5.1        Transfer to Third Parties\n\
We may share your Personal Data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table \u201CPurposes for which we will use your Personal Data\u201D in section 4.2 for which we will use your Personal Data above. This includes:\n\
\n\
- analytics providers such as Google based outside the EU;\n\
\n\
- advertising services such as Google Ads by Google based outside the EU;\n\
\n\
- authentication service providers (\u201Csign-up/sign-in\u201D or \u201Clogin with\u201D) such as Facebook, GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn, each of them based outside the EU;\n\
\n\
- VAT number validation service providers such as VIES VAT by the European Commission, based inside the EU;\n\
\n\

\n\
- other services providers including cloud and content delivery network (CDN) service providers such as Hetzner Cloud and Amazon Web Services, based in- and outside the EU;\n\
\n\
- recipients of Profiles created by you; and\n\
\n\
- Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.\n\
\n\
We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\
\n\
With regard to Yatta Profiles: Please note that we cannot guarantee that recipients of your Profiles will not store or otherwise process your Profile Data. Therefore, we encourage you to restrict the group of recipients of your Profiles where possible and to avoid including Personal Data from Profile Data where possible.\n\
\n\
5.2        International Transfers\n\
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.\n\
\n\
Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented before the transfer takes place:\n\
\n\
- We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of Personal Data in non-EU countries (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).\n\
\n\
- In the absence of such an adequacy decision, we may use specific contracts with such third parties approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). In addition to the Standard Contractual Clauses, we will implement further safeguards if it is necessary to ensure an adequate level of protection for such transfer of your Personal Data.\n\
\n\
Please contact us if you require further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.\n\
\n\
5.3        Links to Third-Party Solutions\n\
Our Websites, products, and services as well as any content or listed Yatta Solutions on the Yatta Platform may include links to third-party websites (e.g. vendor websites), plug-ins, and applications (e.g. authentication services, such as \u201Csign-up/sign-in\u201D or \u201Clogin with\u201D Facebook, GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn). Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share your Personal Data. We do not control these third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave Our Websites, products, or services, we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of every website you visit.\n\
\n\
The same applies to the usage of any vendor Solutions.\n\
\n\
6.          DATA SECURITY\n\
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used, accessed, altered, or disclosed in an unauthorized way. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\n\
\n\
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable authority of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\n\
\n\
7.          DATA RETENTION\n\
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.\n\
\n\
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your Personal Data: see Your Legal Rights section below for further information.\n\
\n\
In some circumstances, we will anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you (see above, Aggregated Data).\n\
\n\
If you have an account with us, you also have the possibility to delete such account. Upon your request, Yatta will disable your account and delete your Personal Data related to the account after six months following your request, unless you reactivate your Account with our consent within the six months period or Yatta is required to keep your Personal Data by law. Your right to request the deletion of your Personal Data pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR as outlined below in section 9 remains unaffected.\n\
\n\
8.          HOW WE USE COOKIES\n\
8.1        What are Cookies and why do we use them?\n\
Our Websites, products, and services use cookies to distinguish you from other users. This helps us to provide you with a brilliantly simple user experience when you browse Our Websites and use our products and services, and it also allows us to improve our offering.\n\
\n\
A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.\n\
\n\
This section will apply accordingly with regard to other similar browser technologies, such as the browser's local or session storage.\n\
\n\

\n\
- Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7 (3) GDPR). You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data (Art. 6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR).

\n\
- Request correction of your Personal Data (Art. 16 GDPR). This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\
\n\
- Request erasure of your Personal Data (Art. 17 GDPR). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law.
