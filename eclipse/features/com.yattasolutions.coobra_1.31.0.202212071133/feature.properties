\n\
(e)         In the event of a workaround, the Licensor will completely rectify the defect within the scope of the next regular update cycle.\n\
\n\
8.2.2    If and to the extent that remedy of the defect pursuant to section 8.2.1 has failed, You may at Your option:\n\
\n\
(a)         demand a reduction of the remuneration; or\n\
\n\
(b)         in case the defect is significant, terminate this EULA for important cause and assert a claim for compensation of damages or fruitless expenditures within the limits of section 9 and 10 of this EULA.\n\
\n\
8.2.3    Your warranty rights under this section 8.2 shall be excluded if the defect results from:\n\
\n\
(a)         any change to the Solution not made or approved by the Licensor, except where You can prove that the modification does not cause the defect and does not impair the error analysis and rectification by the Licensor;\n\
\n\
(b)         Your failure to provide an installation or operating environment for the Solution according to the system requirements set forth in the Documentation;\n\
\n\
(c)          software, hardware, firmware, data, or technology not licensed or approved by the Licensor;\n\

\n\
(a)         demand a reduction of the remuneration; or\n\

(b)         in case the defect is significant, terminate this EULA for important cause and assert a claim for compensation of damages or fruitless expenditures within the limits of section 9 of this EULA.\n\
\n\
8.3.3    Your warranty rights pursuant to this section 8.3 are excluded if the alleged or actual infringement was caused by:\n\

\n\
(b)         the modification of the Solution by any party other than the Licensor;\n\

(c)          the combination or use of the Solution with software, hardware, firmware, data, or technology not licensed or approved by the Licensor; or\n\

\n\
8.4        General Warranty Provisions\n\
8.4.1    Irrespective of whether a material defect or defect of title already existed at the time of the conclusion of this EULA, the Licensor shall only be liable to the extent that the Licensor is responsible for the circumstances causing the defect. A strict liability for defects at the time of contract conclusion pursuant to section 536a par. 1 var. 1 of the German Civil Code shall be excluded.\n\
\n\
8.4.2    You are not authorized to rectify defects by Yourself or have them rectified by any third party (replacement performance). Section 536a par. 2 of the German Civil Code shall not apply.\n\
\n\
8.4.3    Remediation of a defect by the Licensor pursuant to sections 8.2.1 and 8.3.1 is considered as failed if:\n\
\n\
(a)         the defect has not been remedied after the Licensor has been given two attempts to effect supplementary performance;\n\
\n\
(b)         supplementary performance is impossible due to objective or subjective reasons;\n\

\n\
(d)         the Licensor has seriously and ultimately refused supplementary performance.\n\
\n\
8.5        Assertion of Warranty Claims\n\
The timely rectification or material defects and/or defects of title requires that You have (i) adequately documented such defects in a manner comprehensible to the Licensor (e.g. in the case of material defects by means of screenshots, error messages, and generated error reports) ("Bug Report") and (ii) provided such Bug Report to the Licensor in text form (e.g. directly via the error reporting function within the Solution (if available), the support website, trouble ticket system (if available), or by email) immediately after determination of any such defect.\n\
\n\
9.           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\
The Licensor's total liability for all claims shall be subject to the limitations set out herein:\n\
\n\
9.1        Unlimited Liability. The Licensor shall be liable without limitation according to the statutory provisions for damages in the event of:\n\
\n\
(a)         intentional or gross negligent acts including the fraudulent concealment of known defects;\n\
\n\
(b)         damage or loss arising from death or personal injury irrespective of the level of culpability;\n\
\n\
(c)          damages according to the German Product Liability Act or comparable laws in other jurisdictions; or\n\
\n\
(d)         a breach of guarantee assumed by the Licensor.\n\
\n\
9.2        Limited Liability. The Licensor shall be liable for a breach of contractual obligations which jeopardize attainment of the contractual purpose ("Cardinal Obligation") in case of only simple negligence up to the limited extent that is typically contractually foreseeable.\n\
\n\
9.3        Exclusion of Liability. In all other cases than those specified in sections 9.1 and 9.2, the Licensor's liability shall be excluded.\n\
\n\
9.4        Contributory Negligence and Data Backup. If a damage or loss is caused both by a fault of the Licensor and by Your own fault, Your contributory negligence shall be taken into account. In particular, You are responsible for the regular backup of Your data. In the event of a loss of data based on the fault of the Licensor, the Licensor shall only be liable for costs of restoring data from Your regular backup copies and for the reconstruction of data that would have been lost even if regular backup copies had been made.\n\
\n\
9.5        Applicability. The above limitations and exclusions shall apply to all claims for damages, whether based on contract or tort, and to all claims for reimbursement of futile expenses. The above limitations and exclusions shall also apply with regard to the personal liability of the Licensor's employees, representatives, staff, or vicarious agents.\n\
\n\
10.       DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY FOR FREE VERSIONS\n\
10.1      Subject to section 9.1, the Licensor's liability in connection with Free Versions shall be excluded except for intent or gross negligence.\n\
\n\
10.2      A claim for damages arising from a material defect or a defect of title related to a Free Version is only permissible if the Licensor fraudulently conceals such defect.\n\
\n\

This EULA shall enter into effect upon successful completion of Your purchase of the Solution via the Yatta Marketplace and shall have the term You selected during the ordering process and confirmed in the License Confirmation ("License Term").

For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of the termination notice pursuant to Central European Time is determining for compliance with the notice periods.\n\
\n\

\n\
If You withdraw from this EULA, we shall reimburse You all payments we have received from You, including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that You have chosen a type of delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we received the notification of Your withdrawal of this EULA.

\n\
14.       COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA\n\

\n\
15.       PUBLICITY AND MARKETING\n\
15.1      You hereby consent that the Licensor and \u2013 if the Licensor is not Yatta \u2013 Yatta may promote the Solution by naming Your business as a licensee of the Solution (e.g. by issuing or allowing for any press releases or similar communications or displaying corresponding information on the Yatta Platform and/or websites (e.g. in its customer reference listing)).\n\
\n\
15.2      For that purpose, You hereby grant to Yatta a non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free license to reproduce, display and use Your business\u2019 trademarks, trade dress and logos in any form that is customary for the respective and reasonable type of communication.\n\
\n\
15.3      You may withdraw Your consent given under clause 15.1 and Your license granted under clause 15.2 at any time by submitting a corresponding notice to Yatta.\n\
\n\
16.       MISCELLANEOUS\n\
16.1      Entire Agreement. This EULA including its Annexes and the Purchase Order set forth the entire agreement between the parties with respect to this subject matter and supersede all other related oral and written agreements and communications between the parties.\n\
\n\
16.2      Amendments and Updates of this EULA. The Licensor may update the terms of this EULA from time to time. If the changes do not have a material negative impact on You, these shall become binding once they have been published on the Yatta Marketplace, sent to your User Account, or upon any other notification (e.g. via email). In this case, the updated EULA will not require any further notification or acceptance by You. In case of any other changes, You will be notified and asked to accept such update.

\n\
16.4      Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this EULA by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by a written waiver by a duly authorized representative. No waiver of a breach of this EULA will constitute a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of this EULA. An assignment in contravention of this section will be null and void. Except to the extent identified in this subsection, this EULA will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties.\n\
\n\

This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your residential or business seat abroad or not. If You are a Consumer, this choice of law shall not, however, have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable on the basis according to Art. 6 I of the Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I).\n\
\n\
16.7      Jurisdiction. To the extent, You are residing outside Germany, and You are an entrepreneur, company, private or public corporation, or public authority, or to the extent You are residing in Germany, You are a merchant, a public corporation or an authority under public law, or a special asset under public law (�ffentlich-rechtliches Sonderverm�gen), the exclusive venue for any claims under this EULA shall be Frankfurt am Main (Germany), where Yatta acts as the Licensor, otherwise Licensor's business seat as set out in the License Confirmation. This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your general jurisdiction inside Germany or not, provided that (i) You have relocated Your residence or habitual abode out of Germany, or (ii) Your residence or habitual abode is not known at the time of institution of legal proceedings. Mandatory regulations of the Council Regulation (EC) on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters) shall remain unaffected.\n\
\n\
16.8      Dispute Resolution. The EU Commission has created an internet platform for online dispute resolution. The platform serves as a point of contact for the out-of-court settlement of disputes concerning contractual obligations arising from online purchase contracts. More information is available at the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. We are neither willing nor obliged to participate in a dispute resolution procedure conducted by a consumer arbitration board.\n\
\n\
16.9      Severability. Should any provision of this EULA be or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the other provisions of this EULA shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. The parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision by a legally valid arrangement which is consistent with the intentions of the parties to the relevant contract or what would have been the intention of the relevant parties if they had recognized the invalidity or unenforceability, as the case may be.\n\
\n\
