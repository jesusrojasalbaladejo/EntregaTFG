10.	MISCELLANEOUS\n\
10.1	This Agreement applies to You without prejudice to any other agreements (e.g., the Terms of Service), which You may need to enter into separately in order to use all features of the Yatta Platform and Yatta Profiles. Subject to sentence 1 and unless otherwise agreed, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between You and Yatta with respect to Your use of Yatta Profiles, superseding and extinguishing any prior agreements, representations, and understandings between You and Yatta, whether in written or oral form. No variation of this Agreement shall be effective without Yatta’s prior written consent. \n\
10.2	Yatta may update this Agreement from time to time. In such case, Yatta shall notify You via email sent to the email address provided within Your Account. You have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with section 12 if You do not agree with the changes.\n\
10.3	Should a provision of this Agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. The Parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a legally valid arrangement that is consistent with the intentions of the Parties to the relevant contract or what would have been the intention of the relevant Parties if they had recognized the invalidity or unenforceability, as the case may be.\n\
10.4	The Yatta Platform is operated by Yatta from its offices in Germany. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and legal requirements that apply to Your use of the Yatta Platform and Yatta Profiles. \n\
10.5	This Agreement and the use of the Yatta Platform is governed by and construed with, the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The rules of private international law and the Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your residential or business seat abroad. If You are a consumer, this choice of law shall not, however, have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable on the basis according to Art. 6 I of the Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I). \n\
10.6	To the extent You are residing outside Germany, and You are an entrepreneur or a Business, or to the extent You are residing in Germany, You are a merchant, a public corporation or an authority under public law, or a special asset under public law (öffentlich-rechtliches Sondervermögen), the exclusive venue for any claims under this Agreement shall be Frankfurt am Main, Germany. This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your general jurisdiction inside Germany or not, provided that (i) You have relocated Your residence or habitual abode out of Germany, or (ii) Your residence or habitual abode is not known at the time of institution of legal proceedings. Mandatory regulations of the Council Regulation (EC) on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters shall remain unaffected.\n\
10.7	The EU Commission has created an internet platform for online dispute resolution. The platform serves as a point of contact for the out-of-court settlement of disputes concerning contractual obligations arising from online Purchase contracts (potentially such as the Solution Contracts). More information is available at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. We are neither willing nor obliged to participate in a dispute resolution procedure conducted by a consumer arbitration board.\n\
10.8	Yatta may notify You with respect to the Yatta Platform by sending an email message to Your email address registered with the Account, via messages displayed in the Yatta Platform or (with regard to general notifications without particular importance) by posting on the Yatta website. For contractual purposes, You consent to receive communications from Yatta electronically and You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Yatta provides to You electronically will, unless applicable mandatory law requires otherwise, satisfy any legal requirements that such communications have to be in writing. You may notify Yatta by sending an email or a letter to: \n\
