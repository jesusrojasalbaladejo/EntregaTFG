Important Notice\n\
These terms and conditions of service (the "Agreement") apply to you as a user of the Yatta Platform ("You"). Prior to any use of the Yatta Platform, and regardless of whether You use the Yatta Platform as a Vendor, user or Customer, it is required that You agree to the following Agreement without change. If You use the Yatta Platform on behalf of an entrepreneur, a company, private or public corporation, or public authority (each a "Business" and collectively, "Businesses"), such Business is also bound to this Agreement. \n\
If You do not entirely understand or agree to this Agreement, do not click "Sign up", and do not use the Yatta Platform.\n\
Introduction\n\
(A)   Yatta Solutions GmbH, located at Universitaetsplatz 12, 34127 Kassel, Germany ("Yatta") operates and maintains the "Yatta Platform". The Yatta Platform combines software and infrastructure services to help businesses build, provide and distribute digital products, services, assets and other content (collectively, "Solutions") to other Businesses and end-users (collectively, "Customers").\n\
(B)   The "Yatta Marketplace" forms part of the Yatta Platform. It, inter alia, enables "Vendors" (which may be a third party or Yatta) to license and sell Solutions directly to Customers via different channels. The Yatta Marketplace can be accessed and used either via the relevant Yatta Marketplace website or via the "Yatta Marketplace Client". Technically, the Yatta Marketplace Client is a plugin or extension for supported third-party software (such as the open-source Eclipse IDE). In order to use the Yatta Marketplace, You need to create a user account for the Yatta Platform ("Account") as described in Part A) section 3.\n\
(C)   This Agreement consists of two parts:\n\
Part A) (General Terms) is relevant to You regardless of whether You use the Yatta Platform as a Vendor or a Customer.\n\
Part B) (Customer Terms) contains terms and conditions which are applicable to You as a Customer of Solutions via the Yatta Platform.\n\
\n\
\n\
Part A) General Terms\n\
\n\
1. Yatta's Role as a Platform Provider\n\
1.1   Yatta operates and maintains the Yatta Platform including the Yatta Marketplace.\n\
1.2   Any Solutions on the Yatta Marketplace are offered either by third-party Vendors or Yatta, and require the conclusion of a separate license agreement governing the use of that Solution ("Solution Contract"), usually in the form of an \u201EEnd User License Agreement" ("EULA"). The respective License Fee (as defined in the EULA) for a Solution has to be paid by the Customer to the respective Vendor. All payments related to transactions on the licensing and sale of Solutions via the Yatta Marketplace will be handled and processed by third-party payment providers selected by Yatta ("Payment Providers"). For the purpose of this Agreement, "Purchase" means purchasing or acquiring a Solution, a license to a Solution, a subscription, or any other kind of transaction as set forth in the respective Solution Contract.\n\
1.3   Except where Yatta is the Vendor of the Solution (as specified in the EULA), Yatta acts solely as the platform provider who facilitates the transactions carried out on the Yatta Marketplace. Yatta is neither the purchaser nor the seller of such Solutions, and therefore neither a party to nor otherwise involved in the corresponding Solution Contract. Yatta does neither assume any responsibility arising out of or in connection with such Solution Contracts, nor act as an agent on any party's behalf.\n\
1.4   You acknowledge that some aspects of the Purchase of Solutions for which Yatta is not the Vendor and the performance of the respective Solutions Contracts entail the ongoing involvement of Yatta (e.g., provision and calculation of pricing information, listing, reviews and other guidance, license verification, provision of automatic updates). However, Yatta does not review any such Solutions and related information and has no control over and does not guarantee or warrant the existence, quality, safety, maintenance or legality of any such Solutions, the truth or accuracy of any such Solutions, listings or feedback, the ability of Vendors to license, sell and maintain such Solutions, the ability of Customers to pay for such Solutions, or that a Customer or Vendor will actually complete or reverse (e.g., in case of cancellation) a transaction.\n\
\n\
2. Use of the Yatta Platform\n\
2.1   General\n\
2.1.1 In order to use the Yatta Platform, You must be at least 16 years of age.

You must not access the Yatta Platform if You are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using any Purchased or otherwise acquired Solutions under the laws of the country in which You reside or from which You access or use Yatta Marketplace.\n\
2.1.2 If You want to offer Solutions on the Yatta Marketplace, You have to be or represent a Business and You, respectively the Business, need to be admitted as an authorized Vendor, which requires entering into an agreement with Yatta (the "Vendor Agreement").

2.1.3 Unless otherwise stated, You may use the Yatta Platform worldwide without any warranty, guarantee or liability of Yatta as is technically and legally available in the respective country.

\n\
10.   Term and Termination\n\
10.1  Term of this Agreement\n\
This Agreement is made for an indefinite term and shall be effective immediately until terminated by either party as set forth herein.\n\

10.2.1   You may terminate this Agreement (i) any time by clicking on "Delete account" in Your Account or (ii) by sending Yatta an email from the email-address registered with Your Account with thirty (30) days prior notice. \n\
10.2.2   Yatta may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days prior notice. In addition, and without prejudice to any other of Yatta's rights or remedies, Yatta may terminate this Agreement (or any part of it) with immediate effect for cause, in particular if:\n\

(d)   You have materially violated obligations towards other Vendors or Customers;\n\
(e)   Yatta deploys Updates that You reject and if the continuation of this Agreement cannot be reasonably be expected by Yatta (e.g., due to commercial reasons);\n\

(h)   Yatta, taking into account all the circumstances of the specific case and weighing the interests of both parties, cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed end; or\n\
(i)   termination for cause is otherwise permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\
10.3  Effects of Termination\n\
10.3.1   Upon termination in full, Yatta will disable Your Account and preclude access to the Yatta Platform. If You have Purchased any Solutions, Yatta may keep Your Account information for license compliance issues. Yatta will delete Your Account information no later than six months after following the termination, unless (i) You reactivate Your Account with Yatta's consent within the retention period, (ii) Yatta is required to retain Your Account Information (or parts thereof) by law, or (iii) Yatta has a legitimate interest in retaining Your Account information (e.g., in case of Your claims against Yatta or claims of Yatta against You). \n\
10.3.2   If You have Purchased any Solutions on a subscription basis via the Yatta Marketplace, the termination of this Agreement (including Your Account) terminates the respective license(s) to the next possible termination date (as defined in the Solution Contract).

If You would like to continue to use any terminated Solution beyond its termination date, You must manually resubscribe.\n\
10.3.3   If you have Purchased any Solutions on a perpetual basis via the Yatta Marketplace, the Solution will remain in full force and effect following termination of this Agreement. However, Yatta does not warrant that the Solution can be continued to be used and operated following termination and Yatta shall have no liability whatsoever in that respect; each Vendor is solely responsible that a Solution Purchased on a perpetual basis will continue to be usable and operate independently from Yatta Platform Software.\n\
10.3.4   Upon the termination, and unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, You shall cease all use of the Yatta Platform and destroy all copies of the Yatta Platform Software. \n\
10.3.5   Termination does not affect any agreement You have with third parties (e.g., Payment Providers, Customers and/or Vendors). You will also remain fully liable for all amounts due under Your Account.\n\
\n\
11.   Miscellaneous\n\
11.1  This Agreement applies to You without prejudice to any other agreements (e.g., the Vendor Agreement, the terms of the respective Payment Provider or EULAs for Solutions), which You may need to enter into separately in order to use all features of the Yatta Platform. Subject to sentence 1 and unless otherwise agreed, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between You and Yatta with respect to Your use of the Yatta Platform, superseding and extinguishing any prior agreements, representations, and understandings between You and Yatta, whether in written or oral form. No variation of this Agreement shall be effective without Yatta's prior written consent. \n\
11.2  Yatta may update this Agreement from time to time. In such case, Yatta shall notify You via email sent to the email address provided within Your Account. You have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with section 10 if You do not agree with the changes.\n\
11.3  Should a provision of this Agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. The Parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a legally valid arrangement that is consistent with the intentions of the Parties to the relevant contract or what would have been the intention of the relevant Parties if they had recognized the invalidity or unenforceability, as the case may be.\n\
11.4  The Yatta Platform is operated by Yatta from its offices in Germany. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and legal requirements that apply to Your use of the Yatta Platform. \n\
11.5  This Agreement and the use of the Yatta Platform is governed by and construed with, the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The rules of private international law and the Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your residential or business seat abroad. If You are a consumer, this choice of law shall not, however, have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable on the basis according to Art. 6 I of the Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I). \n\
11.6  To the extent You are residing outside Germany, and You are an entrepreneur or a Business, or to the extent You are residing in Germany, You are a merchant, a public corporation or an authority under public law, or a special asset under public law (�ffentlich-rechtliches Sonderverm�gen), the exclusive venue for any claims under this Agreement shall be Frankfurt am Main, Germany. This shall apply irrespective of whether You have Your general jurisdiction inside Germany or not, provided that (i) You have relocated Your residence or habitual abode out of Germany, or (ii) Your residence or habitual abode is not known at the time of institution of legal proceedings. Mandatory regulations of the Council Regulation (EC) on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters shall remain unaffected.\n\
11.7  The EU Commission has created an internet platform for online dispute resolution. The platform serves as a point of contact for the out-of-court settlement of disputes concerning contractual obligations arising from online Purchase contracts (potentially such as the Solution Contracts). More information is available at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. We are neither willing nor obliged to participate in a dispute resolution procedure conducted by a consumer arbitration board.\n\
11.8  Yatta may notify You with respect to the Yatta Platform by sending an email message to Your email address registered with the Account, via messages displayed in the Yatta Platform or (with regard to general notifications without particular importance) by posting on the Yatta website. For contractual purposes, You consent to receive communications from Yatta electronically and You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Yatta provides to You electronically will, unless applicable mandatory law requires otherwise, satisfy any legal requirements that such communications have to be in writing. You may notify Yatta by sending an email or a letter to: \n\

\n\
1. Purchase of Solutions\n\
1.1   Your order of any Solution via the Yatta Marketplace constitutes an offer to the respective Vendor to conclude a Solution Contract.

\n\
2. License for Solutions\n\
