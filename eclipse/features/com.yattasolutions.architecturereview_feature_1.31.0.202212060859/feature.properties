2. SUBJECT MATTER\n\
2.1  SUBJECT MATTER\n\
The subject matter of the Contract is the provision of the Software in the edition selected, for use over the limited License Period and contractual term, including the granting of the rights pursuant to Item 3 hereunder that are required for using the Software in accordance with the Contract.\n\
\n\
2.2  Agreed Characteristics\n\
2.2.1  The Software's characteristics and functions are conclusively stated in the License Schedule and in the enclosed functional specifications (entitled "Functionality"). The details thus provided are to be regarded as specifications of performance, not as guarantees. A guarantee is only given if it is expressly termed such.\n\
2.2.2  The product specifications, illustrations, drawings, particulars, performance data and other data and information provided on Yatta Solutions' website or otherwise made available, do not constitute a guarantee or any other kind of warranty of specific characteristics (sec. 536 of the German Civil Code).\n\
\n\
2.3  Other Services\n\
2.3.1  Other services - in particular: certain functional extensions, adjustments to specific (hard- or software) systems not supported by the latest version, installation, maintenance, configuration, training, and other advisory services - are not covered by this Contract and are therefore not owed by Yatta Solutions.\n\
2.3.2  The parties may reach a separate agreement on the provision of such services.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
3. Granting of Rights\n\
3.1  Licensed Rights, Number of Licenses\n\
3.1.1  In accordance with the following Terms, the Licensee is granted the non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide right of use in the Software, which right may not be sub-licensed and is limited in time to the term of the License and of the software lease.\n\
3.1.2  The type of use that is permitted (in particular the type of hardware on which the Software may be used), the scope of use that is permitted (in particular the number of licensed devices and the number of users, or - in the case of floating licenses - the number of users who may use the Software simultaneously), and the number of licenses granted (number of license keys issued) under each order, all depend on the further agreements reached by and between the parties (as documented in the License Schedule), and in particular on the edition of the Software and the number of licenses for said edition of the Software that are specified in the parties' contractual agreement.  The editions available and the respective rights granted in each case are described in the annex Types of Licenses.\n\
\n\
3.2  Using Templates\n\
3.2.1  The Licensee is also granted the right to modify and use in modified form the templates incorporated in the Software for its own development purposes, or to use the Software to create new templates and subsequently modify and use same. The extent to which this type of use is permitted is the same as that applying to the original software pursuant to Item 3.1.\n\
3.2.2  When the Licensee uses the Software, including the templates, for developing computer programs, small individual extracts from the templates may also be copied into the computer programs being developed. The Licensee is granted in perpetuity the non-exclusive worldwide right to reproduce and distribute such extracts in modified or unmodified form and to make same available to the public, insofar as such extracts form a constituent part of the computer programs and are required for running them.\n\
3.2.3  For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly stated that the Licensee's use of the Software merely for its designated purpose does not result in Yatta Solutions acquiring the Licensee's rights in the computer programs or in any parts of the computer programs that are developed by the Licensee with the aid of the Software.\n\
3.2.4  Unless a free edition of the Software is involved, the granting of rights pursuant to the above paragraphs is subject to the condition precedent of payment in full of the license fees owed in accordance with Item 4.\n\
\n\
3.3  Correcting Errors, Decompilation\n\
3.3.1  Beyond this, the Licensee is authorized to reproduce, process, decompile or otherwise re-engineer the development stages of the Software solely in accordance with the following provisions.\n\
3.3.2  Reproducing and altering the Software is permitted if and insofar as this serves to eliminate a defect in the Software and Yatta Solutions has defaulted in remedying such defect. If the Licensee calls in a third party for this purpose who works on a commercial basis, then such third party may not be a potential competitor of Yatta Solutions, if there is a risk of any essential program functions or operating principles being disclosed during the elimination of the defect.\n\
3.3.3  Decompiling the code provided is permitted, insofar as such decompilation serves to obtain the information required for achieving the inter-operability of an independently developed computer program, if such information cannot otherwise be obtained without difficulty. Decompilation is only permitted provided the Licensee has previously requested Yatta Solutions for the information that is needed on a time-and-cost basis, and provided Yatta Solutions has failed to comply with such request within a reasonable period.\n\
3.3.4  Moreover, modifications are admissible for which permission may not be refused in accordance with principles of good faith (Copyright Act, Sec. 39 Para. 2).\n\
\n\
3.4  Backup Copies\n\
3.4.1  The Licensee is allowed to make backup copies of the Software insofar as they are necessary for the use of the computer program in accordance with its intended purpose.\n\
3.4.2  The Licensee must label each backup copy it makes "Backup Copy" and affix the manufacturer's copyright notice so that it is clearly visible.\n\
\n\
3.5  Inadmissible Use\n\
3.5.1  Beyond the instances specified in Items 3.1 to 3.4, the Licensee is not entitled to copy or use the Software in any other manner.\n\
3.5.2  In particular, the Licensee is not entitled to allow third parties to use the copy of the Software that is delivered or any backup that is made, nor is it entitled to sell, lend or hire out the Software, or to sub-license it, or to communicate it to the public or make it available to the public.\n\
\n\
3.6  Legal Consequences of Inadmissible Use\n\
3.6.1  If the Licensee violates the License Terms, then Yatta Solutions may demand in text form that such violation cease within a reasonable period. If the Licensee fails to comply by the deadline set, then Yatta Solutions may give immediate notice terminating the contract. When such notice is issued, all the rights of use granted hereunder shall immediately revert to Yatta Solutions.\n\
3.6.2  The licensee's obligations in this case are determined by Item 5.5; asserting further rights shall in no way be affected by this provision.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
4. LICENSE FEES\n\
4.1  Amount\n\
4.1.1  Unless otherwise agreed, the amount payable in license fees is given in Yatta Solutions' pricelist as applicable on the date when the Licensee places the order.\n\
4.1.2  Unless otherwise stated, statutory turnover tax at the rate in force at the time and any other taxes, duties and levies applicable have to be added to all the prices given on Yatta Solutions' website.\n\
\n\
4.2  Payment\n\
4.2.1  The full license fees fall due for payment within 14 days of the date of invoice.\n\
4.2.2  If the License Period is renewed, Yatta Solutions may bill the customer for the renewal period as from the date on which termination of the License Period still running can no longer be terminated pursuant to Item 6.2.3 below. In this case also, the license fees fall due for payment within 14 days of the date of invoice.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
5. LICENSEE'S OBLIGATIONS\n\
5.1  Yatta Solutions' Intellectual Property\n\
The Licensee undertakes to heed Yatta Solutions' rights and in particular its intellectual property:\n\
(a)  by not exceeding the admissible use pursuant to Item 3 in terms of either quality or quantity;\n\
(b)  by not passing on any copies of the Software to third parties and not enabling third parties to make copies;\n\
(c)  by neither manipulating the Software hereunder contrary to statutory regulations or contractual provisions, nor enabling this to be done.\n\
\n\
5.2  Protecting the Software\n\
The Licensee is obligated to take suitable measures to protect the Software - as well as the access data and any License Keys, as the case may be - from access by unauthorized third parties. In particular, all copies of the Software and the License Keys must be kept in a safe place.\n\
\n\
5.3  Onus of Proof\n\
If the Licensee is an entrepreneur (German Civil Code, Sec. 14), it shall have the onus of proof that all the organizational measures have been taken in an appropriate manner and to a sufficient extent, such as are required to best prevent inadmissible use of the Software by third parties within its area of risk, in particular inadmissible disclosure, copying or publication, and that at a minimum it applies the same degree of care as for protecting its own confidential information.\n\
\n\
5.4  Obligation to Provide Information\n\
On request, the Licensee shall inform Yatta Solutions about the number of copies and location of the Software put to use by it, its vicarious agents and its sub-contractors.\n\
5.5  Post-Contractual Obligations\n\
If notice of termination is given, if the License Period expires, or if the Contract ends for any other reason, then the Licensee must immediately and entirely discontinue using the Software, erase all the installed copies of the Software, delete, destroy or hand over any copies handed over by Yatta Solutions or any backup copies made, and issue legally binding confirmation to this effect if Yatta Solutions so demands.\n\
\n\

The last usage period is the duration of the previous renewal or the previous license period.
6.2.2  The calendar date shall be decisive. If contract closure is on February 29, then the decisive date in the following year shall be February 28.\n\
6.2.3  In the event of (automatic) renewal having been agreed, the Contract may be terminated by either party giving six weeks notice before the end of the license period running at the time.

No warranty is given that the Software is suitable for a specific purpose. In particular, no warranty of specific characteristics is given. Item 2.2 must be taken into account.\n\
9.1.2  The Licensee's attention is drawn to the possibility of thoroughly testing the Software prior to purchase by way of the FREE Trial.\n\
\n\
9.2  Scope of the Warranty\n\
9.2.1  Yatta Solutions warrants that the Software's contractually agreed quality characteristics shall be maintained throughout the contractual term (License Period), and that no third-party rights conflict with using the Software in accordance with the Contract.\n\
9.2.2  Material defects and defects in title occurring in the Software shall be eliminated by Yatta Solutions within a reasonable period of their being reported by the Licensee. Any errors shall be  remedied by making free subsequent repairs or a free substitute delivery, at Yatta Solutions' option, and in particular by supplying, transmitting or providing an Update, by way of a Patch or Release, or by notification of a Work Around.\n\
9.2.3  The Licensee may derive the right to give notice from deprival of use pursuant to Civil Code, Sec. 543 Para. 2 Clause 1 No. 1 solely if subsequent repairs or substitute delivery fail. Such failure shall only be deemed the case if Yatta Solutions has had sufficient opportunity to render post-performance, if post-performance is impossible or is refused or unreasonably delayed by Yatta Solutions, if there are well-founded doubts as to whether post-performance will succeed, or if post-performance cannot reasonably be expected for other reasons.\n\
9.2.4  For the avoidance of doubt, Item 10 also applies to any damages caused by a breach of the above warranty.\n\
\n\
9.3  Special Provisions for Entrepreneurs\n\
If the Licensee is an entrepreneur within the meaning of Sect. 14 of the German Civil Code, it must inspect the Software for obvious defects without delay, i.e. at the latest within three days of delivery, and any defect discovered must immediately be reported to Yatta Solutions in writing, failing which Yatta Solutions' guarantee for such defect shall be excluded. The same applies if any such defect is subsequently discovered. Section 377 of the German Commercial Code applies. Providing software products for the Customer to download from a server through the Internet shall also be deemed a delivery within the meaning of this clause.\n\
\n\
9.4  Licensee's Obligations to Cooperate\n\
9.4.1  The Licensee is responsible for describing any defects occurring and their respective symptoms as best as possible, in order for them to be reproduced and subsequently eliminated. The time at which each defect occurred and the accompanying circumstances must be specified in sufficient detail.\n\
9.4.2  As regards content, format, type and scope, descriptions of defects should be provided in accordance with the provisions of Yatta Solutions' Support Policy pursuant to Item 8.1. At its own discretion, Yatta Solutions shall provide suitable media and tools for this to be done (e.g. email address, telephone hotline, trouble ticket system, support forum).\n\
\n\

10.1.1  Yatta Solutions shall be liable towards consumers (Civil Code, Sec. 13) in accordance with (a) and towards entrepreneurs (Civil Code, Sec. 14) in accordance with (b) below.\n\
(a)  Yatta Solutions shall have unrestricted liability towards consumers in cases of intent, gross negligence, mortal injury, physical harm or health damage, and to the extent of any guarantee it has assumed. In the event of a breach of cardinal duty pursuant to Item 10.1.2 that is due to slight negligence, Yatta Solutions shall assume liability that is limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the type of contract.\n\
(b)  Yatta Solutions shall have unrestricted liability towards entrepreneurs in cases of intent, a breach of cardinal duty pursuant to Item 10.1.2 that is due to gross negligence, mortal injury, physical harm or health damage, and to the extent of any guarantee that has been assumed.

10.1.2  Cardinal duties are obligations having to be performed in order to attain the contractual purpose in the first place, and which the parties may therefore rely on being performed.\n\
10.1.3  Even if liability applies pursuant to Item 10.1.1, liability for loss of data vis-à-vis both consumers and entrepreneurs shall be limited to the time and cost for restoring the data that would have been incurred if data backups in accordance with Item 10.3.2 had duly been made to cover the risk.\n\
10.1.4  The limitations set forth above in Items 10.1.1 through 10.1.3 also apply to claims for the payment of damages caused by initial defects in the Software.\n\

\n\
10.2  Exclusion of Liability\n\
10.2.1  Beyond the provisions of Item 10.1 above, Yatta Solutions' liability for whatsoever legal cause is excluded.\n\

Liability for gross negligence shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the type of contract, unless and to the extent the matter involves claims for damages by the Licensee that are based on mortal injury, physical harm or health damage.\n\
11.2.3  The statutory regulations laid down the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) shall remain unaffected.\n\
11.2.4  Items 10.1.3 and 10.4 apply.\n\

\n\
UML Lab\n\
Functionality\n\
UML Lab is a modeling IDE for the modeling and programming of software which is integrated into the Eclipse open source development environment. The software extends the Eclipse IDE by providing a tool for the visual modeling of software and for aligning model and source code.\n\
\n\
1. Class Diagram Editor\n\
UML Lab incorporates an editor for modeling software by means of diagrams based on the required UML specification.\n\
1.1  UML Lab modeling editor - scope of functionality\n\
The UML Lab diagram editor enables diagram files with the following UML syntax elements to be created, displayed, modified and stored:\n\
Association \n\
Aggregation \n\
Class \n\
Composition \n\
Dependency\n\
Enumeration\n\
Extension \n\
Generalization \n\
Interface \n\
InterfaceRealization \n\
Package \n\
PackageImport\n\
Stereotype\n\
Usage\n\
\n\
In addition to the above, secondary elements are also supported, including Property, Operation and Literal.\n\
1.2  Operating functionality\n\
The diagram editor is operated using the mouse and keyboard. Elements are added to a diagram using the tool palette on the right-hand side of the diagram or using mouse gestures. Selected elements can be deleted using the keyboard or the main menu.\n\
\n\
2. Round-Trip-EngineeringNG\n\
UML Lab Round-Trip engineering uses specified text (templates) not just for code generation, but also for Reverse Engineering. The templates can be created and/or edited by the user; templates are also supplied with UML Lab. Round-Trip-EngineeringNG enables model and source code to be aligned with each other using the following functions:\n\
2.1  Code generation\n\
UML Lab uses a variety of Eclipse technologies (principally Xpand/Xtend) for generating codes. The code generator processes UML syntax elements, as listed in greater detail in Item 1.1, and generates source code from these by means of templates. Templates in Xpand template language are used for configuring the code generator.\n\
\n\
2.2  Tem plate-based Reverse Engineering\n\
For Reverse Engineering, all the available templates are aligned with the source code to be imported. In this process, the mechanism attempts to reconstruct a model which generates the imported source code again. Where a model already exists, an attempt is made to adjust this with as few modifications as possible so that the result generates the imported source code.\n\
\n\
(a)  Limits to template-based Reverse Engineering\n\
The option of constructing models completely and unambiguously using templates from existing source code is restricted for mathematical reasons. UML Lab Reverse Engineering produces complete and unambiguous results where:\n\
the expressions used in the templates (see Item 2.3) are unambiguously reversible\n\
partial information, which is determined for one source code file in each case, can be combined to produce a complete model, or\n\
partial information can be used for the local modification of an existing model without giving rise to contradictions when generating code again.\n\
UML Lab checks whether the existing source code in its available form can be generated from the model. Where the above conditions are not met, Reverse Engineering will produce either no results or suboptimal results only.\n\
Where the results for one individual model element are obtained from several source code files, these are merged into sets. In the event of conflicts arising between the individual results, the last source code file to be processed takes precedence.\n\
\n\
(b)  Dealing with deviations\n\
Where deviations occur between model and source code, UML Lab takes the user to an error dialog screen in order to establish how this should be dealt with. The user has the option of buffering the deviations that have occurred and allowing them to be incorporated continuously into code generation, or alternatively of undoing the modifications made to the model.\n\
In individual cases, Reverse Engineering may not be able to deliver any result at all to the source code files specified and no associated elements will be applied in the model. Subsequently, the existing source code file will not be overwritten by the code generator.\n\
\n\
2.3  Templates\n\
For template-based Round-Trip-Engineering, a subset of the template language Xpand is used. The following language constructs from Xpand are supported:\n\
IMPORT\n\
EXTENSION\n\
FILE\n\
EXPAND\n\
FOREACH\n\
IF\n\
LET\n\
Please note: For Reverse Engineering, the file name of the FILE instruction must be taken from the content of the generated file.\n\
In addition, the following language constructs of the expression language Xtend are also supported:\n\
Extension (except for Create-~)\n\
Select\n\
Typeselect\n\
Set operations: union, toList, size, get, indexOf, contains, isEmpty\n\
Switch\n\
Cast\n\
The use of other language constructs from Xtend is permitted for code generation; however, these are not processed through UML Lab Reverse Engineering. In this case, it will not be possible to create the complete model from the source code, should the situation arise.\n\
\n\
2.4  Operating Round-Trip-EngineeringNG\n\
Round-Trip-EngineeringNG is used with a variety of wizards that can be accessed by the user via the main menu and/or the context menu. Source code can also be imported using template-based Reverse Engineering by dragging & dropping the respective files.\n\
After first carrying out Round-Trip Engineering, code model alignment is automatically performed for manual modifications made to a source code file, and this applies equally to modifications in the model. The alignment is carried out as standard at the point when the source code file resp. the model/diagram is saved.\n\
Please note: The standard Round-Trip-EngineeringNG procedure on saving can be disabled via the menu and subsequently initiated manually.\n\
Weitere Benutzerinformationen finden sich in der UML Lab Guided Tour sowie in der Benutzerdokumentation.\n\
More user information is provided on the UML Lab Guided Tour and in the user documentation.\n\
We would particularly like to bring to users' attention the FREE TRIAL offered by Yatta Solutions so that users can try out UML Lab and Round-Trip-EngineeringNG at no charge.\n\
\n\
2.5  Templates supplied\n\
Yatta Solutions supplies a standard set of templates with UML Lab:\n\
Standard Java\n\
Contains a general template set for Round-Trip Engineering of Java source code from a UML model. This creates source code for the following UML elements:\n\
Association \n\
Class \n\
Enumeration\n\
Generalization \n\
Interface \n\
InterfaceRealization\n\
The template set abstracts attributes and associations for UML implementations from technical access methods.\n\
JPA\n\
A template set for the Round-Trip Engineering of data models according to the JPA Standard. In this process, abstraction is carried out from technical access methods and from annotations of the JPA Standard. In addition, cross-references are triggered in the model between annotation attributes and declarative descriptors. UML Lab supports the following data-related subsets of annotations from JPA Version 1.0:\n\
AssociationOverride\n\
AssociationOverrides\n\
AttributeOverride\n\
AttributeOverrides\n\
Basic\n\
CascadeType\n\
Column\n\
DiscriminatorColumn\n\
DiscriminatorValue\n\
Embeddable\n\
Embedded\n\
EmbeddedId\n\
Entity\n\
Enumerated\n\
GeneratedValue\n\
Id\n\
IdClass\n\
Inheritance\n\
JoinColumn\n\
JoinColumns\n\
JoinTable\n\
Lob\n\
ManyToMany\n\
ManyToOne\n\
MappedSuperclass\n\
OneToMany\n\
OneToOne\n\
PrimaryKeyJoinColumn\n\
PrimaryKeyJoinColumns\n\
SequenceGenerator\n\
Table\n\
Transient\n\
UniqueConstraint\n\
Version\n\
Legacy Templates\n\
An essential template set for the Reverse Engineering of legacy code. Legacy templates serve as a fallback in the event that the remaining templates are unable to create the existing source code. This template set does not abstract from the details of the source code, but instead reproduces it as far as possible 1:1.\n\
2.5.1 Integrating users' own extensions\n\
\n\
2.6 UML Lab can be extended as defined by the user using code styles in the form of UML profiles and templates. For UML Lab to function correctly, users' own templates need to be syntactically correct in terms of the re-check in the template editor. Otherwise, the limitations referred to in Item a apply accordingly.\n\
User-defined profiles cover the UML elements Stereotype, Stereotype Attribute and Extension, as well as associations with pre-defined metaclasses.\n\
\n\
